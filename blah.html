<em>Note: this is an update to an article I wrote in 2010, when I went from college to full time freelance.</em>&lt; I started
freelancing all the way back in 2002, when my church came to me looking for a website. As a junior in high school, I used
Frontpage, and GMail had yet to grace me with it's presence. And this seemed like a really good opportunity for me to run
the business I always wanted. I freelanced all through high school and college. It was at the end of my senior year in 2007
that I realized I wanted to keep doing it. So I went to grad school to learn more about my trade, and better prepare myself
for freelancing in the real world. <span class="complexword"><span data-offset-key="4a5o4-3-0">However</span></span>
<span
    data-offset-key="4a5o4-4-0">, turned out to be harder than I thought. I got my Masters Degree in May of 2009 and wasn't quite prepared for the roll of
    full time freelancer. I stuck with it for a time but sought full time employment for 6 years before coming back to self-employment.</span>

    So what does it take to transition to full time freelancing (from school or employment)? Let me tell you what I've learned.

    <h3>Be Financiall Ready</h3>

    First and foremost, you need to have money saved. This is for the slow times, the extra bills you will likely incur, and
    tax time. I recommend starting as early as possible and putting as much as you can in an interest bearing account. I
    had 6 months income in savings I could draw from. And I needed it! Less than 1 month after I went full time freelance,
    I racked up almost $3000 in unexpected expenses. [bctt tweet="I had 6 months of income in savings before going self-employed"
    username="jcasabona"] On top of that, get rid of any debt you can. Quite frankly, student loans suck, especially if you
    go to an expensive school. You could be looking at $500/month in loans. But unless you want to wait 25 years to start
    a business, you're stuck with those. Because of this, you need to </span><span class="complexword"><span data-offset-key="104bi-3-0">eliminate</span></span>

                <li data-offset-key="b273e-0-0"><strong>When do I start looking for a new job</strong>? Is it when savings gets to a low point? Is it some
                    number of weeks without new work? Whatever it is, you need to make this hard decision for your well being
                    and that of your family.</li>
                <li data-offset-key="b273e-0-0"><strong>Can you still freelance with the full time job you get</strong>? Some places will make you sign non-competes,
                    barring you from doing work in a similar field. You may not have time anymore. How do you want to handle
                    it?</li>
                <li data-offset-key="b273e-0-0"><strong>What will you do with your current clients</strong>? How do you want to wrap up any current projects?

                <li data-offset-key="b273e-0-0"><strong>What about current services</strong>? I offered hosting to my clients before I got a full time job.
                    I worked out a way to continue offering that service. You'll need to do the same thing, especially if
                    you choose not to freelance at all anymore.</li>
